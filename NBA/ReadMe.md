I've developed a console app using OOP which reads the path to a JSON file. After that i parse it using JSON.net
Deserialization. I store the data in a model called Player. I've build services for code reusing. Seperated the
different classes in class libraries then connected them with refferences.Developed some filters in the InputService.
